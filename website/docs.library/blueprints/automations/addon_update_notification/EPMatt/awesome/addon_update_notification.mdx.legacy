## Description

Send a notification to the provided mobile devices whenever an update for the given Home Assistant add-on is available.

Supports full notification customization, notification groups, auto-dismissal when the add-on is updated, and a button for starting the update
directly from your notification tray, with an optional notification after the update completed successfully.

This blueprint does not require any additional sensor to be manually set up, since it uses the built-in add-on sensors introduced with the
Supervisor integration starting from Home Assistant Core **2021.4.0**.

## Requirements

<LibraryRequirement name="Home Assistant Supervisor + Integration" required>

To use this blueprint you must have a Home Assistant instance running as **Home Assistant OS** or **Home Assistant Supervised**.

You must also have the **Home Assistant Supervisor** integration enabled and correctly set up (enabled by default starting from Home Assistant Core 2021.4.0).

Add-on sensors are disabled by default. Make sure to enable the following entities for the add-on you plan to track:
- `sensor.<addon>_version`
- `sensor.<addon>_newest_version`
- `binary_sensor.<addon>_update_available`

#### How to enable add-on entities
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations**
2. Open **Home Assistant Supervisor**
3. Click **Entities**
4. Select the entities above and click **Enable Selected**
