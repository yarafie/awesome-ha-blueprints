## Description

This blueprint enables sending Web UI persistent notifications (created using the
`persistent_notification.create` service) to a specified mobile device or device group.

It also allows filtering which notifications are forwarded based on the provided
notification ID.

The blueprint works on both **iOS** and **Android** devices. On Android, notifications
can be grouped and assigned to a specific channel to apply custom settings such as sound
and vibration.

This blueprint is useful whenever a Web UI persistent notification should also be
reported on a mobile device.

It is especially helpful in scenarios where a notification cannot be sent directly to a
mobile device, such as:
- System-generated persistent notifications (invalid login attempts, setup required)
- Supervisor alerts
- Integrations or add-ons that report events using
  `persistent_notification.create` instead of firing custom events

Opening the notification on the mobile device does **not** dismiss the corresponding
persistent notification in the Home Assistant Web UI.

## Requirements

<LibraryRequirement name="Persistent Notification Integration" required>
This integration must be enabled, as persistent notifications in the Web UI are generated
by it. It is enabled by default unless explicitly disabled.
[Persistent Notification Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/persistent_notification/)
</LibraryRequirement>
<LibraryRequirement name="Mobile App Integration" required>
Provides the service required to send notifications to mobile devices. Enabled by default.
[Mobile App Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app/)
</LibraryRequirement>
<LibraryRequirement name="Home Assistant Companion App" required>
Install and configure the official Home Assistant Companion App on all target devices.
[Home Assistant Companion App Docs](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic#sending-notifications-to-multiple-devices)
</LibraryRequirement>
<LibraryRequirement name="Notify Group Integration" required>
Allows sending notifications to multiple devices at once using notification groups defined
in `configuration.yaml`.

## Additional Notes

If you use notification groups that include **both iOS and Android devices**, some
features (such as Android notification channels and grouping) may not behave consistently.

Refer to the official documentation for further details:
