## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2001/E2002 STYRBAR Remote control. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller device itself. However, It needs to be enabled in the blueprint.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and maybe more in the future. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e2001_e2002#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt' />
<Requirement id='zha' />
<Requirement id='deconz' />

## Inputs

<Inputs category='controllers' id='ikea_e2001_e2002' />

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### (Default) Mapping

- Up button short press -> Turn on
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Turn off
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Right button short press -> Color up
- Right button long press -> Color up (continuous, until release)
- Left button short press -> Color down
- Left button long press -> Color down (continuous, until release)

#### (Option 1) Mapping

- Up button short press -> Brightness up
- Up button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Turn on
- Down button short press -> Brightness down
- Down button long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Turn off
- Right button short press -> Color up
- Right button long press -> Color up (continuous, until release)
- Left button short press -> Color down
- Left button long press -> Color down (continuous, until release)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### (Default) Mapping

- Up button short press -> Play/Pause
- Up button long press -> Volume up (continuous, until release)
- Down button short press -> Stop
- Down button long press -> Volume down (continuous, until release)
- Right button short press -> Next track
- Left button short press -> Previous track

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.

#### (Default) Mapping

- Up button short press -> Open cover
- Up button long press -> Open the cover tilt
- Up button double press `Virtual` -> Stop cover and cover tilt
- Down button short press -> Close cover
- Down button long press -> Close the cover tilt
- Down button double press `Virtual` -> Stop

## Additional Notes

### Virtual double press events

It's important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

## Changelog

- **2021-11-07**: first blueprint version :tada:
- **2022-08-08**: Optimize characters usage for the `helper_last_controller_event` text input.
- **2025-01-02**:
  - (ZHA) Fixed a bug preventing long pressing actions to be triggered. ([@Ivarvdb](https://github.com/Ivarvdb))
  - (Zigbee2MQTT) handle "unknown" state. ([@beardhatcode](https://github.com/beardhatcode))

  :warning: **Breaking Change**:

  Migrate to Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Device Triggers. ([@yarafie](https://github.com/yarafie))

  The `controller_entity` input has been deprecated, and `controller_device` is now mandatory.
  If you are a Zigbee2MQTT user and plan to update this blueprint, please make sure to remove the `controller_entity` input from your automation config and add the device ID of your controller to the `controller_device` input.
  To obtain the device ID from your controller, configure the automation from the UI and use the device selector dropdown on the `controller_device` input to select your controller.

- **2025-03-20**: Standardized input naming format for controller devices and virtual button actions. No functionality changes.
- **2025-04-01**: Fix double-click detection logic. ([@danleongjy](https://github.com/danleongjy))
- **2025-04-16**: Fix Long Press Down not releasing ([@kkthxbye-code](https://github.com/kkthxbye-code))
