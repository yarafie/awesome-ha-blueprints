## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Shelly SNSN-0024x Plus i4 with Wall switch 4. Supports controllers integrated with Shelly. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and maybe more in the future. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](#available-hooks) for additional details.
