## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2001/E2002 STYRBAR Remote control. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as controlling a light brightness, or lowering the volume of a media player).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller device itself. However, It needs to be enabled in the blueprint.

Automations created with this blueprint is not connected to any [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks).

## Available Hooks

There are no available hooks for this device.

## Additional Notes

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events..

### Issues with Zigbee2MQTT and the device firing duplicate events

It has been reported that IKEA E2001/E2002 controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT might fire duplicate events from time to time, during interaction. This issue is not relative to the blueprint itself.

If you notice your controller is not behaving as expected please reset the device and repeat the pairing process with Zigbee2MQTT, then try again.
