## Description

This blueprint provides support for running custom actions whenever any of the four rocker buttons are used on EnOcean PTM 215Z (Friends Of Hue) compatible switches. It supports Zigbee2MQTT and emits semantic `ahb_controller_event` actions that can be consumed by Hooks.

Long-press actions can be looped until the corresponding release is received, allowing smooth dimming and continuous color adjustments in linked Hooks.

::::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow you to quickly build controller-based automations for lights, media players, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Additional Notes

- The switch reports `press_*` and `release_*` events; this blueprint translates those into semantic short/long/release actions.
- `hold_delay` controls when a press is treated as a long press.
