## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E2001/E2002/E2313 STYRBAR Remote control. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA, deCONZ. The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).

The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller device itself. However, It needs to be enabled in the blueprint.

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and maybe more in the future. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement id='zigbee2mqtt'/>
<Requirement id='zha'/>
<Requirement id='deconz'/>
<Requirement name='Input Text Integration' required>

This integration provides the entity which must be provided to the blueprint in the **Helper - Last Controller Event** input. Learn more about this helper by reading the dedicated section in the [Additional Notes](#helper---last-controller-event).

## Available Hooks

:::note Virtual double press actions
Some of the following mappings might include actions for virtual double press events, which are disabled by default.
If you are using a hook mapping which provides an action for a virtual double press event, please make sure to enable support for virtual double press on the corresponding buttons with the corresponding blueprint input.

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

## Additional Notes

### Helper - Last Controller Event

The `helper_last_controller_event` (Helper - Last Controller Event) input serves as a permanent storage area for the automation. The stored info is used to implement the blueprint's core functionality. To learn more about the helper, how it's used and why it's required, you can read the dedicated section in the [Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#helper---last-controller-event-input).

The helper is used to determine button release events when the controller is integrated with Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA, because of the actions mapping for the controller with these integrations. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different button release events for some of it's buttons, so the blueprint must store the previous clicked button.

### Virtual double press events

It's also important to note that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. Instead , this blueprint provides virtual double press events. You can read more about them in the [general Controllers-Hooks Ecosystem documentation](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem#virtual-events).

### Issues with Zigbee2MQTT and the device firing duplicate events

It has been reported that IKEA E2001/E2002/E2313 controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT might fire duplicate events from time to time, during interaction. This issue is not relative to the blueprint itself.

If you notice your controller is not behaving as expected please reset the device and repeat the pairing process with Zigbee2MQTT, then try again.
