## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Smarthjemmet.dk QUAD-ZIG-SW 4 button remote. Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as controlling a light brightness).

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/smarthjemmet_dk_quad_zig_sw#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Button 1 short press -> Turn on
- Button 1 long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Button 1 double press -> Color up
- Button 2 short press -> Turn off
- Button 2 long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Button 2 double press -> Color down

#### Mapping #2

- Button 3 short press -> Turn on
- Button 3 long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)
- Button 3 double press -> Color up
- Button 4 short press -> Turn off
- Button 4 long press -> Brightness down (continuous, until release)
- Button 4 double press -> Color down
