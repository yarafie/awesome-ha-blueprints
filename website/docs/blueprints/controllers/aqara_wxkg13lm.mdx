## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided Aqara WXKG13LM Wireless Mini Switch T1.
Supports controllers integrated with Zigbee2MQTT.
The blueprint will automagically detect the integration type and take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as controlling a light brightness or lowering the volume of a media player).

:::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with lights, media players, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](/docs/blueprints/controllers/aqara_wxkg13lm#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a light. Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Toggle
- Button double press -> Brightness up
- Button triple press -> Brightness down
- Button long press -> Brightness up (continuous, until release)

[Light Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/light)

### Media Player

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Play pause
- Button double press -> Next track
- Button triple press -> Previous track
- Button long press -> Stop

[Media Player Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player)

### Cover

This Hook blueprint allows to build a controller-based automation to control a cover. Supports opening, closing and tilting the cover.

#### Default Mapping

- Button short press -> Open cover
- Button double press -> Close cover
- Button long press -> Stop cover and cover tilt

[Cover Hook docs](/docs/blueprints/hooks/cover)

## Additional Notes

### Multiple button presses

Please note that although this blueprint provides support for the controllers single [1], double [2], triple [3], quadruple [4], quintuple [5] and many [more than 5] button presses.
In practicle use, it is found that beyond triple [3] presses, results may vary.
