## Description

This blueprint provides support for running custom actions whenever any of the buttons or dial gestures are used on the Philips Hue Tap dial switch (models 8719514440937 / 8719514440999). It targets controllers integrated via Zigbee2MQTT and normalises the event set exposed by the device, including button presses and brightness step events.

Long press inputs optionally loop until a matching release event is received, mirroring the behaviour of other Awesome HA Blueprints controllers.

::::tip
Automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](/docs/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow you to quickly build controller-based automations for lights, media players, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Available Hooks

### Light

This Hook blueprint allows you to control a light including brightness and colour adjustments using the Tap dial's buttons and dial gestures.

/>

## Additional Notes

- The dial emits brightness step events which are exposed as dedicated controller actions to keep discrete adjustments distinct from continuous button holds.
- Releases for long button presses are surfaced as their own actions, allowing Hooks or custom sequences to stop loops or handle clean-up when the button is released.
