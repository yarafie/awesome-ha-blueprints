### Overview

**Controllers** are blueprints that allow you to integrate a wide range of physical controllers (wall switches, remotes, dimmers, etc.) into Home Assistant and use them to trigger actions when interacting with them.

They act as an **abstraction layer** that normalizes raw controller events coming from different integrations such as **Zigbee2MQTT**, **ZHA**, **deCONZ**, or **Shelly**, so you can build powerful controller-based automations without worrying about protocol-specific details.

You can integrate Controllers with [Hooks](./hooks) and create controller-based automations to control lights, media players and much more, without having to write a single line of code.

:::tip
Controllers are part of the **Controllers–Hooks Ecosystem**. You can read more about this topic [here](/docs/controllers-hooks-ecosystem).
