## Preface

**Awesome HA Blueprints (yarafie Fork)** Welcome to yarafie's Fork of awesome-ha-blueprints.

I wasn't planning to come back to this fork, but I've had some time on my hands.
I've updated this fork, cleaned it up (No Security Vulnerabilities at least according to the github tab on top, which you probably don't see anyways :100: )
I've rolled in and fixed many issues that were reported on EPMatts Repo and folded in some pull requests that EPMatt didn't get around to, and added additional devices that don't exist in his repo.

I'll try to keep this fork updated as much as possible, but I'm the sole maintainer so I'll get to things when I get to them :+1: .

For now, just enjoy.
